        "I feel like the whole Asian identity part to it gets stressed a lot, you know. Wanting Asian representation in media– I think that’s great. But for me, personally, I feel like the bigger part, the more important part to me is making good art. Whether I’m Asian or not shouldn’t have anything to do with it. And I know that’s kinda what you guys are going for which makes a lot of sense, but I think that when you try to stress that you are an Asian-American artist, it’s almost like you’re trying to carve out a space for yourself that says, “Hey, this guy is an Asian artist so you should give him attention because of that”, when the real reason you should be giving someone attention is because their art is just good. I’ve strayed a little bit away from doing those kinds of organizations because I didn’t want to be labeled as an Asian-American artist, I just want to be an artist. I think that’s where I found success, just doing my thing. "
